				our other associated platforms, leisure and business travelers can explore, research, compare prices and book a wide range of services catering to their travel needs. Since our
				inception in 2006, more than 4 million customers have used one or more of our comprehensive travel-related services, which include domestic and international air ticketing,

				India, we are India’s largest platform for domestic hotels.
			<br><br>
				A strong and "trusted" travel brand of India, our strengths include a large and loyal customer base, a multi-channel platform for leisure and business travelers, a robust 
				mobile eco-system for a spectrum of travelers and suppliers, a strong technology platform designed to deliver a high level of scalability and innovation and a seasoned senior
				management team comprising of industry executives with deep roots in the travel industry in India and abroad.
			<br><br>
				The acquisition of companies, intellectual property and talented individuals has been central to our growth strategy. In 2010, we acquired TSI and its subsidiaries in order
				to expand our B2B business, particularly our international air ticketing for small and medium scale enterprises. In 2012, we acquired Travelguru B2B and B2C entities from
				Travelocity, which remain well-established hotel aggregators in India. Through this acquisition, we expanded our hotel business by establishing more direct hotel relationships
				in India and improved our inventory of affordable travel options. We have also leveraged our leading position in the Indian travel ecosystem to make several “acqui-hires”, 
				including the teams from mGaadi and dudegenie, in order to grow our business.
			<br><br>
				We are dedicated to ensuring a superior user experience on our platform and a critical component of that is customer service. We provide customer support at all stages of
				our customer’s journey – before, during and after. Our customer “touch-points” include our website, mobile platforms, retail stores, call centres, a network of over 14,000
				agents across India addressing the needs of a large fragmented market of travel agents and a portfolio of B2E clients across India employing over 1.4 million people.
